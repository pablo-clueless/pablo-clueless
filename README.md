### /about.
I am a full stack developer with love for coding. The endless possibilities of the web fuels my passion. I constantly endeavor to get better and surpass my threshold to deliver outstanding results. I am currently crunching numbers as a frontend engineer at [Zummit Africa](https://github.com/Zummit-Africa-Inc).

When I'm not coding, I am coding :smile:. I like to learn more in my spare time and to the things I love. I contribute to open source at [communitypro](https://github.com/CommunityPro).  I relax by playing video games, watching anime and reading books. You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pablo_clueless) and [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samson-okunola/).

### /porfolio
You can find most of my works in my [repo](https://github.com/pablo-clueless?tab=repositories) and some pens you can look at on [codepen](https://codepen.io/pablo-clueless)
