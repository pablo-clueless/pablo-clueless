### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

## **I'm Okunola Samson**

I have been a developer for almost how long now? 5 - 6 years. I am based in Lagos, Nigeria. I currently work at [Optimus AI Labs](https://www.optimusai.ai/) as a frontend engineer. I'm passionate about building software that solves real-world problems. I write TypeScript, Golang, and C#. I am currently learning Rust and distributed systems. I have come to appreciate simple design patterns, clean code, and sound architecture. I am co-building [Datarango](https://datarango.com) with [Jonathan Enudeme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-enudeme/). 

I'm an irregular writer on [Hashnode](https://clueless-developer.hashnode.dev/). I love playing video games, watching anime, and reading books. I am big fan of minimalism.
